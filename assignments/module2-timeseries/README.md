# Assignments for time series: 

1. Learn the concepts and vocabulaty in TestAssignment.md

2. Execute the notebooks that appear here, and extend them to data of your own -- ideally as a step toward your course project. 

3. As always, scout out and please share what you find on the Web that might be of general interest. Be an active learner.
