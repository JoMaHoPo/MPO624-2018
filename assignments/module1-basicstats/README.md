# Assignments for basic statistics.

1. Operate the _distributions_ notebook, learn its lessons, study how it works.

2. From the File menu, Make a copy and then Rename it. 

3. Based on some curiosity, which you express as a question, bring your own data into at least 2 of the notebook's plots. Delete unneeded cells (with the scissors). Be careful! Upper cells affect lower cells. For instance, you will need to retain all the **import** statements, in order to have the same packages. 

4. Add Markdown cells at the bottom, plot titles, and other forms of reader-friendly text, to explain what you learned about your data (that is, about the world) from this exercise. In other words, bring the technical activity back to science in the end. It can be a small thing, especially in the first (_distributions_) example.
