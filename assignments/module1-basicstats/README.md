# Assignments for basic statistics.

1. Operate the _distributions_ notebook, learn its lessons, study how it works.

2. From the File menu, Make a copy and then Rename it. 

3. Based on some curiosity, which you express as a question, bring your own data into at least 2 of the notebook's plots. Delet unneeded cells (with the scissors). Be careful! Upper cells affect lower cells. For instance, you will need to retain all the **import** statements, in order to have the same packages. 

4. Add some Markdown cells, to explain something you learned about your data (that is, about the world) from this exercise.
