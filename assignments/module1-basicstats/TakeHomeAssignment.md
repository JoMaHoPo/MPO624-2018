# Module 1 essentials
### Problems to do. Turn in next Tuesday. Mini-exam Tuesday will ask a few of the key points of it. 

1. Know the definitions of cov(X,Y) = cov(Y,X), std(X) and std(Y), _r_ (the correlation coefficient), reg(Y,X) and reg(X,Y) which are **not equal**. Know the word _anomaly_ or _perturbation_ (indicating that the mean of a variable has been removed), and the word _standardized_ (indicating that the anomaly has been normalized by standard deviation, making a _unitless_ quantity). 

2. Know the _principle of least squares_. Know that, for simple regression, it is equivalent to the principle that _the regression term captures all of the linear relationship with the "predictor" (or "independent") variable_, so that _the residual is uncorrelated with the predictor variable_. Know how to explain these in your own words -- that is, how to _convince me_ that you really understand these principles!

3. Do the worksheet (TakeHomeAssignment.ipynb) which has the proper math symbols that Markdown can't display. 

4. Understand these terms well enough to explain them in your own words (or perhaps math jots), **correctly and completely** -- with extra points for _concisely_.
