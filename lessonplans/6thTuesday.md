### Our last theory day in the Basic Statistics module

1. Hand out the homework/ take-home part of exam on regression basics, and the vocabulary list for the in-class mini-exam to be held next Tuesday. Emphasize that **orthogonality** is the property we want to focus on going forward, and regression is just a special case of that. 

2. Look in on the multiple regression notebook assignment. Clarify student work expectations. 

3. Show again the IDV connection, how to get data from it, and how to use xarray (instead of bare-bones netCDF reading) to get one's data. 

4. Find out how and why scatter plots are colored in the first notebook. 

Scout assignments? Falling behind on this intention...
