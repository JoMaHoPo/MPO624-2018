# Second thursday

## Last bits of setup, and then plunge into Jupyter notebooks 
  - and how to work with **existing** Python in them
### Not from the beginning, but rather at a high level of science application

## More on Jupyter

## More on Python and the SciPy landscape
### First things to know about Python:
  * Interpreted (not compiled), with integrated graphics
  * Imports modules to do most high-level things
  * Case sensitive (capitalization matters!)
  * Indenting matters in flow control (loops, conditions) -- customarily, 4 spaces
  * Assigns variables by reference, not by value
  * Object-oriented with the . , but also procedural with the ()
  * Has composite data types (lists, tuples, dictionaries)
