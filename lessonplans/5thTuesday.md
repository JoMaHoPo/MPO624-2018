# Second week of basic stats

### A couple scouting reports! Let's look at them. And assign some more...

### How's the distributions - histograms - scatterplots assignment coming? 

## Rationality's simplest tool for measuring its simplest form (linear) of a relationship: the function XY

#### Whiteboard example

1. Postulate your relationship!
  - for scientific theory reasons (physical formulations)
  - for statistics theory reasons (parsimony, Occam's razor, _overfitting_ concerns) 

2. Principles: 
  - _maximizing how much the linear term captures_ 
  - _minimizing the summed-square residual_
  - **these are the same**
