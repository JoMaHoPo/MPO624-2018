## There are 3 mini-exams (quizzes, really), and a final exam (may be take-home).
### Mini-exams
  * One per 4-week module (basic stats, timeseries, empirical-decomp)
  * Half-class length, closed book, on take-away points, immediately after a review half-class

### Final exam
  * Show your knowledge by short answers defining terms in a great big long vocabulary list
  * List will be published here throughout the course, no surprises. ASK! 
  * May be done as a take-home, + random in-class quiz to make you upload it all (good for memory)
