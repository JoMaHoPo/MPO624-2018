# MPO 624 CLASS FOR SPRING 2018

### Software Installs: 
####  1. GitHub

* consider installing the desktop client https://desktop.github.com/
* make an account on github.com (the desktop client will prompt you on launch, or you can go directly). 
    * Consider browsing the Guides at https://guides.github.com/
        - Perhaps make yourself a simple web page at GitHub Pages
    * or dig into deeper “training" https://services.github.com/on-demand/

#### 2. Jupyter

Many of our assignments will take place in Jupyter notebooks, running the Python3 interpreter (kernel). Notebooks are an example of the “literate programming” movement: documents made for human readers, with inset blocks of code that actually run, and can be played with and rerun. It functions as both a light coding environment and a communication format. Matlab has devised something similar, in its “live scripts”. So, please
* install anaconda (the big package with more than we need) or miniconda3 (the basic system, easily expanded) from anaconda.com
* if you run Windows, you may need to install “powershell” 

* We will launch ourselves from this training set, https://unidata.github.io/unidata-python-workshop/
See the installation instructions there for information on how to set up a Python environment with the appropriate packages. 
If you have time, dig in and see how far you can get. 


#### 3. IDV. 
Install the IDV nightly build from Undiata. Great free software, my group (and Xingchen in class) are involved with integrating it into Jupyter notebooks.

You will need to create a light sign-in, just so they know who’s using it. 



#### optional Matlab 
Matlab is free to you while you are at UM. You will need to create an account with them, verify license tokens, etc.  It is very powerful, and very well documented with lots of hand-holding features, but it is commercial and proprietary. I will not use my course to create a generation of addicts to it, but you might end up using it -- lots of scientists do, and a big body of working, legacy code is nothing to sneer at. You can install it from here.
